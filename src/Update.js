    You should maintain at least 1 metre distance from others. It os necessary because when someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.

    <Card.Text>
    You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare providerâ€™s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room.
